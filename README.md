📊 Customer Trends & Purchase Behavior Analysis

Python | MySQL | Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping and purchase behavior to uncover revenue trends, customer segments, and product performance insights. The project follows a complete, real-world data analytics workflow — from raw data cleaning to SQL analysis and dashboard visualization — making it suitable for data analyst portfolio and job applications.

🎯 Business Problem

Businesses often struggle to understand:

Which customer segments generate the most revenue

Whether discounts and subscriptions increase spending

Which products perform best across categories

How customer behavior varies by age, gender, and purchase history

This project addresses these questions using structured data analysis and visualization.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas) – data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering

MySQL – structured data storage and SQL-based analysis

SQLAlchemy – integration between Python and MySQL

Power BI – interactive dashboard and data storytelling

🔄 Project Workflow

Loaded raw customer transaction data (customer_shopping_behavior.csv)

Cleaned and transformed data in Python (removed irrelevant columns, handled missing values)

Performed feature engineering (age groups, customer segments, total spend)

Exported cleaned data (cleaned_customer_data.csv)

Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database

Wrote business-focused SQL queries for KPI and trend analysis

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to present insights

📈 Key Analysis Performed
